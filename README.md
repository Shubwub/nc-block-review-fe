# NC-NEWS
A simple news/article site built as a result of the frontend 'block-review' on the ninth week of the NorthCoders training course. The purpose of building this was as a means of examining the skills that had been learned throughout my time on the course, and across the 3 weeks we'd spent coverig ghe react JS framework. This frontend connects to the API I built - hosted at : <https://shubwub-nc-news.herokuapp.com/api> (<https://github.com/Shubwub/nc-block-review-be>).
